          <h2>About this page</h2>
          <p class="lead">We are asking you to participate in this collaborative tool and study with the main objective of validating methods to detect and prevent the psychological consequences of trauma during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p class="lead">Psychological trauma can be induced by experiencing brutal experiences to yourself or seeing them upon somebody else.</p>
          <p class="lead">Psychological trauma can be induced by physical violence, sexual violence, emotional abuse, severe injury, life threat, sudden death of a loved one, or if you harmed someone.</p>
          <p class="lead">Consequences of trauma are well known and can induce Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms. If they persist more than 1 month, they define a Post-Traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD) (after around 10 % of the trauma).</p>
          <p class="lead">However, the best prevention to avoid the evolution toward the PTSD is still being researched in the clinical community. Using this tool, you will also provide data about the best way to deal with such consequences and limit the stress of future traumatized patients.</p>
          <p class="lead">Specifically, we will assess the risk factors of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and orient you to a randomized treatment to compare the interest of: </p>
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>standard psychological support, </li>
              <li>social support alone, </li>
              <li>visuo-spatial activity like the Tetris® video game</li>
          </ul> 
          <h2>Benefits</h2>
<p class="lead">It is possible that you will benefit from such interventions by improving your response to the trauma event and gaining information about your status. The app will refer you to a professional if it detects high levels of distress. By helping to identify possible factors related with the development of PTSD, and the best strategy to deal with them, you will contribute to help future patients from this disorder, and to enhance our knowledge on this issue.</p>
We do not expect any specific side effect but we think that the evolution of the Post traumatic Stress symptoms will evolve differently in the 3 different situations.</p>

           <p class="lead">to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder after a trauma.</p>
           <p class="lead">If you agree, we will send you reminders to follow the evolution of trauma symptoms.</p>
          <p class="lead">We do not expect any specific side effect but we think that the evolution of the Post traumatic Stress symptoms will evolve differently in the 3 different situations.</p>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p class="lead">We will assess the kind of trauma you experienced, the risk and protective factors that are supposed to worsen or improve the evolution, then, we will orient you in a 1/3 randomised way to each of the threee intervention that we propose to do in the 24h after the trauma. You will be asked to report the following day if you had intrusive memories and their impact and such everyday for 30 days. After one month, we will assess the symptoms of PTSD, if such exist, we will be able to report the scale to your usual general practionnor (family doctor) and we will provide you the contaxct of mental health professional. We would recommend you to discuss it with your general practionner to confirm the diagnosis and help you to get the best orientation. If a PTSD exist at one month, we will consequently assess the symptoms of PTSD at 3 months to assess the presence of a chronic PTSD. </p>
